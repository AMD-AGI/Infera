## Ready for review

### [sgl-project/sglang #33059](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/33059) — Make real query rows and padded Aiter metadata agree.

- **State / responsibility:** READY; yihou; delegate unassigned. GitHub assignees: none. Requested reviewers: 1am9trash, hubertlu-tw, kkHuang-amd, HaiShaw, Fridge003, YAMY1234, rainj-me.
- **Base / head:** `main` @ `b45a36531c3673048aeaf35322c3df7f18edd038` / `fix-dsa-indexer-hip-aiter-dp-padding` @ `795488cd19aaa3cc852d6c87ffe36b88af20ca23`.
- **Review / CI:** REVIEW_REQUIRED; mergeability UNKNOWN / UNKNOWN; 0 unresolved inline threads. Checks: CANCELLED 1, FAILURE 7, IN_PROGRESS 3, QUEUED 12, SKIPPED 63, SUCCESS 79. Reviews: claude: COMMENTED (2026-11-02T09:04:20Z).
- **Last curated action:** 2026-11-03 ~06:00 UTC: verified unchanged head 795488cd and active Base attempt 3, started 05:29:05 UTC. Gate passes; 22 test jobs passed, 3 running, 8 queued. Results include retained prior-attempt passes, not 22 new reruns. Latest lint passes; no implementation change or CI retry by this audit.
- **Latest GitHub activity:** [Latest comment 2026-11-03T05:28:28Z](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/33059#issuecomment-6596225432); PR updated 2026-11-03T05:29:29Z.
- **Evidence freshness:** Recorded head unchanged; evidence retains its stated limits. Notes last assessed 2026-11-03; new comments/reviews still require human triage.
- **Activity triage:** GitHub activity timestamp matches the curated audit.
- **Evidence / pack-up:** [Author GPU report](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/33059#issuecomment-6573920447): 8x MI355X DeepSeek-V3.2 DP GSM8K 0.957; basic TP in AMD CI mode 0.958; DP + EAGLE MTP with eager padded rows 0.951 versus unpatched main crashing with lengths must have one entry per score row. Runs used ab4407a57c; independently checked identical production DSA and regression-test Git blobs at current head 795488cd (306d4b5f619fc37d8760d2e22dc07ede2e1d280e and 7a7e8c9b759c80f6666fe80fe793e4cabaacb746). These are author-reported model runs, not rerun by this status audit. The MI300 configuration failed on MI355X both with and without the patch; native MI300 coverage is still absent. Existing 12 CPU regression tests and historical [GLM pack-up](https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Infera/blob/b563462fa4a20b4a6f563d279de14ddee455b343/yihou/glm52.llrepro-pp4-dpa4.packup_20261024/README.md) remain separate evidence.
- **To Ready:** Already Ready by the author/user decision; preserve that state. New MI355X DP and padded MTP evidence supersedes the earlier Draft/missing-matrix assessment. Native MI300 coverage remains a reviewer follow-up, not a Draft promotion step.
- **To merge / dependency:** Ready, run-ci present. [Base attempt 3](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/actions/runs/41423254776/attempts/3) passed the gate and is executing tests. At approximately 06:00 UTC November 3, the run has 22 passed test jobs, 3 running and 8 queued; later dependent stages are not all created. Of the 22 passes, 20 are retained from previous attempts and two completed during attempt 3. This supersedes the old cooldown rejection. Allow active jobs to finish, then address concrete failures and review. Native MI300 qualification remains separate.

### [sgl-project/sglang #46820](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/46820) — Keep a blocked metrics consumer from stopping the scheduler.

- **State / responsibility:** READY; yihou; delegate unassigned. GitHub assignees: none. Requested reviewers: merrymercy, Ying1123, hnyls2002, xiezhq-hermann.
- **Base / head:** `main` @ `e33cd0c3a10474c7a0f6efeb69ce2cf4b7a55021` / `yihou/kv-metrics-nonblocking-20261027` @ `ac205f829173029ce17c1898fd9c8d9ab2f861fd`.
- **Review / CI:** REVIEW_REQUIRED; mergeability UNKNOWN / UNKNOWN; 0 unresolved inline threads. Checks: FAILURE 5, QUEUED 2, SKIPPED 53, SUCCESS 115. Reviews: none.
- **Last curated action:** 2026-11-03 ~06:00 UTC: observed attempt 1 cancellation followed by active attempt 2 at unchanged ac205f82. Two H100 shards queue in the retry; 36 earlier test passes are preserved. Latest lint passes. No code push or CI retry by this audit.
- **Latest GitHub activity:** [Latest comment 2026-11-02T10:07:30Z](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/46820#issuecomment-6574434420); PR updated 2026-11-03T05:24:50Z.
- **Evidence freshness:** HEAD CHANGED: re-audit evidence from 783c1a2192. Notes last assessed 2026-11-03; new comments/reviews still require human triage.
- **Activity triage:** GitHub activity timestamp matches the curated audit.
- **Evidence / pack-up:** [glm52.oai-1p1d-v0521-agentx-c44_20261009.packup_20261012](https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Infera/blob/b563462fa4a20b4a6f563d279de14ddee455b343/yihou/glm52.oai-1p1d-v0521-agentx-c44_20261009.packup_20261012/README.md); c44a to c44b; four real-ZMQ CPU tests pass; no model-throughput claim.
- **To Ready:** No remaining author-side promotion step; no GPU required for the socket contract.
- **To merge / dependency:** Ready, run-ci present. [Base attempt 2](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/actions/runs/41467220762/attempts/2), started 05:45:53 UTC November 3, retries the cancelled H100 base-b-test-1-gpu-large shards (1, 2); both are currently queued. The 36 successful Base test jobs are retained results from before attempt 2, not newly re-executed tests. No Base test assertion failure is observed; overall Base remains incomplete. CI owners: provide runner capacity and let the retry finish before merge. Yihou/delegate: handle concrete failures and review.

- **Last curated action:** 2026-11-03 ~06:00 UTC: refreshed exact-head run/job metadata and corrected the earlier queued assessment to cancelled. 36 Base test jobs passed; two H100 shards were cancelled without execution. No implementation mutation or CI retry by this audit.
- **Latest GitHub activity:** [Latest comment 2026-11-02T10:07:34Z](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/46830#issuecomment-6574436019); PR updated 2026-11-03T05:25:03Z.

- **To Ready:** No remaining author-side promotion step; retain scoped historical evidence.
- **To merge / dependency:** Ready with run-ci. [Base attempt 1](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/actions/runs/41467026948) was cancelled at approximately 05:24 UTC November 3: 36 Base test jobs passed, but H100 base-b-test-1-gpu-large shards (1, 2) never acquired a runner or executed steps and were cancelled. The finish aggregator fails because base-b-test was cancelled; no new Base test assertion failure was observed. Coverage is incomplete. Authorized CI owner: rerun the cancelled checks and obtain a successful aggregate before merge; preserve already completed results.

- **Evidence / pack-up:** [Historical indexer source](https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Infera/blob/b563462fa4a20b4a6f563d279de14ddee455b343/yihou/glm52.patch-inventory_20261027/patches/K01-kf-decode-kernel-overlay.NEWFILES.diff); [PR evidence](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/47872). Author reports exact overflow fallback, valid nondeterministic boundary ties and 1.5–1.9x isolated speedup at 400k contexts/72+ rows, but about 1.3% slower serving at 32k with simulated acceptance 3.61. Real-acceptance GSM8K .953 from one server is a smoke test. Maintenance reproduced candidate underflow in the actual GPU pipeline: original 256 valid slots instead of 2048; fixed 2048 unique valid slots and all 5 GPU tests pass without skips. Run kf47872-20261102T1038Z-topk-underflow used MI355X and the public v0.5.22 ROCm10 image, Torch 2.11.0+rocm10.0.0 / Triton 3.8.0. [Pinned source, CPU/GPU records and reproduction scripts](https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Infera/tree/dev/pd_opt/glm_5.2_agentx/yihou/glm52.patch-inventory_20261027/validation/kf_47872). The GPU runner uses the exact module/tests with namespace and CI-registration shims for the older image; no new server/model/performance result is claimed.
- **To Ready:** Ready restored after the underflow repair, import-guard regression and exact-source MI355X validation. The temporary correctness Draft is resolved; retain opt-in behavior and the historical performance limits.
- **To merge / dependency:** Ready; latest lint passes but run-ci remains absent. [Latest Base](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/actions/runs/41429823967) stops at the missing-label gate; functional tests were not executed.

- **Last curated action:** 2026-11-03 ~06:00 UTC: rechecked unchanged Ready head and passing lint; run-ci still absent. Base run 41428924194 remains gate-blocked, with no functional test execution. No mutation by this audit.

The c2cacf5f candidate matches the frozen indexer module; the PR fixes its fused-pair tail omission. Author reports 2.67–3.06x isolated long-context logits, numerical/top-k checks, and real-acceptance GSM8K means .934 main/.927 PR with overlapping ranges. GSM8K is a short-context smoke test. Serving timings used simulated acceptance 3.61 in a single-node setup, not the frozen PD/AgentX setup. Local PR_NOTES.md and working_process.md identify validation scripts; raw results are not yet a public archived bundle.
- **To Ready:** Already Ready. Preserve existing hardware evidence and the paired-row regression; archived raw run-to-source bundle is still a handoff follow-up.

### [sgl-project/sglang #46826](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/46826) — Allow DCP decode behind DCP1 prefill when transport/backend support it.

- **State / responsibility:** DRAFT; yihou; delegate unassigned. GitHub assignees: none. Requested reviewers: none requested.
- **Base / head:** `main` @ `e0c7992d0d48c8085655752de7a9f43bf1862bbc` / `yihou/rocm-dcp-pd-config-20261027` @ `21f8e688faa155a1f5abaa53ba3ca03c20900d7c`.
- **Review / CI:** REVIEW_REQUIRED; mergeability UNKNOWN / UNKNOWN; 0 unresolved inline threads. Checks: FAILURE 17, SKIPPED 88, SUCCESS 23. Reviews: none.
- **Last curated action:** 2026-11-03: verified unchanged head and Draft state; newest lint passes. No new functional CI result or evidence resolving the existing readiness blockers.
- **Latest GitHub activity:** [Latest comment 2026-11-02T04:22:46Z](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/46826#issuecomment-6568996226); PR updated 2026-11-02T04:23:15Z.
- **Evidence freshness:** Recorded head unchanged; evidence retains its stated limits. Notes last assessed 2026-11-03; new comments/reviews still require human triage.
- **Activity triage:** GitHub activity timestamp matches the curated audit.
- **Evidence / pack-up:** [glm52.dcp4-pd.packup_20261022](https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Infera/blob/b563462fa4a20b4a6f563d279de14ddee455b343/yihou/glm52.dcp4-pd.packup_20261022/README.md) pdBe-r1; current 12 CPU tests +13 subtests cover implicit Triton and a2a Q-rep defaults. Combined graph/coverage gap remains.
- **To Ready:** Complete the supported-configuration coverage with #46824; preserve rejection of unqualified graph/layout combinations. Backend/default policy is already tested; do not wait again for merged #44322.
- **To merge / dependency:** Still Draft with the recorded Ready blockers; latest lint passes. [Latest Base](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/actions/runs/41388093572) rejects Draft and skips functional tests. Yihou/delegate: complete the scoped Ready action first; maintainers then enable required CI and review. #46824 must land before #46826 enables the configuration.

| PR | Purpose | State / head | Dependency / next action |
|---|---|---|---|
| [AMD-AGI/Infera #210](https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Infera/pull/210) | v0.5.22 integrated image recipe | MERGED / `8859b247ce` | Merged image history; reproduce pinned fdbafb60 source rather than substitute arbitrary main. |
| [SemiAnalysisAI/InferenceX #4629](https://github.com/SemiAnalysisAI/InferenceX/pull/4629) | Publish the Infera SGLang AgentX PD recipe. | READY / `69be557c8c` | Upstream #33059/#46830/#46820; progress externally owned absorb-BMM #46918 for issue #46829, now covered by scoped MI355X validation (CI/review/merge and image integration remain); select an image with these plus merged #21194 and remove engine patches. Coordinate #630/#47117, diagnose platform RDMA bring-up, complete sweep and review. |
| [sgl-project/sglang #21194](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/21194) | Fix GLM PP construction on stages without an embedding. | MERGED / `2059478e21` | Validate a pinned image carrying the merged fix. No duplicate filing; preserve historical source and attribution. |
| [sgl-project/sglang #34465](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/34465) | Earlier PP non-first-rank hidden-size proposal | CLOSED / `62cd16df78` | Closed unmerged. Third-party #21194 subsequently merged on October 29 and guards the GLM-5.2 PP construction failure. Validate image inclusion; no new duplicate S13 filing. Preserve archived source and attribution. |
| [sgl-project/sglang #35233](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/35233) | HiCache host-pointer alias resolution | MERGED / `c29e6054f5` | Merged into base lineage; do not reapply old #33968 workaround. |
| [sgl-project/sglang #41395](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/41395) | Early-send consumer completion | MERGED / `9fc5f30621` | Merged in frozen base; preserve separate producer patch. |
| [sgl-project/sglang #42553](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/42553) | Host-allocation pointer handling | MERGED / `b2de502825` | Merged upstream; retain correct frozen-source behavior. |
| [sgl-project/sglang #45524](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/45524) | Producer event before non-final PP KV send | READY / `14c8591329` | External author eaglewangao-us owns this PR. Ready, latest lint passes, but run-ci is absent. [Latest Base](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/actions/runs/40803758455) fails at the missing-label gate and skips functional tests. Maintainer: authorize and trigger CI; original author: respond to review/tests. Yihou tracks producer-ordering relevance and preserves the distinct historical image patch; no duplicate or branch takeover. |
| [sgl-project/sglang #46918](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/46918) | Keep absorb-BMM hand tuning while limiting the waves-per-EU budget that may trigger the gfx950 compiler abort. | READY / `bb5ae4af94` | Ready with run-ci. [Base attempt 1](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/actions/runs/41467734403) was cancelled at approximately 05:24 UTC November 3: 36 Base test jobs passed, but H100 base-b-test-1-gpu-large shards (1, 2) never acquired a runner or executed steps and were cancelled. The finish aggregator fails because base-b-test was cancelled; no new Base test assertion failure was observed. Coverage is incomplete. Authorized CI owner: rerun the cancelled checks and obtain a successful aggregate before merge; preserve already completed results. Original author owns the branch and CI/review follow-up. Our MI355X evidence remains scoped to validated head 9763ef56; the current main-merge head bb5ae4af is not a new full-head hardware qualification. Preserve the frozen image workaround until reviewed integration. |
| [AMD-AGI/Infera #222](https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Infera/pull/222) | Advertise the KV-events port allocated by srt-slurm. | MERGED / `f668fbf773` | Use a release carrying this fix; verify allocated endpoints with colocated prefills. |
| [NVIDIA/srt-slurm #630](https://github.com/NVIDIA/srt-slurm/pull/630) | Launch Infera frontends with etcd-registered SGLang workers. | READY / `a6f98feb37` | Complete frontend integration review; reconcile the recipe backport when merged. |
| [kvcache-ai/Mooncake #4540](https://github.com/kvcache-ai/Mooncake/pull/4540) | Select destination-local GPU write rails. | DRAFT / `6fccbba168` | Coordinate fabric-specific validation and review; not a first-version universal prerequisite. |
| [kvcache-ai/Mooncake #4541](https://github.com/kvcache-ai/Mooncake/pull/4541) | Make RDMA ACK timeout configurable. | DRAFT / `faa24ab499` | Coordinate fabric-specific validation and review; do not attribute RDMA registration EINVAL to ACK timeout without evidence. |
| [sgl-project/sglang #45307](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/45307) | Overlapping gfx950 fused indexer optimization | READY / `1255a0a4ed` | Coordinate overlap with our #47276; rebase whichever lands second. |
| [sgl-project/sglang #47117](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/47117) | Document Infera GLM-5.2 PD on MI355X. | DRAFT / `3e89cdc460` | Original author llying-001 owns code and promotion; coordinate cookbook review/merge with InferenceX #4629. Maintainer approval is needed for Mintlify fork preview. Lint passes; Base is green only through documentation filtering with functional suites skipped. Extra is blocked by Draft, not a test assertion. Yihou supports evidence/command review without taking over the branch. |
| [ROCm/aiter #6697](https://github.com/ROCm/aiter/pull/6697) | Related upstream MoE sort-into-GEMM1 experiment; not our five-hook KF port. | READY / `9a20161613` | External author: resolve current main conflicts and respond to the design objection about merging sorting into GEMM1. Track relevance; do not duplicate or modify the author branch. Our separate five-patch MoE port remains held until an active path and current-baseline gain are demonstrated. |
| [SemiAnalysisAI/InferenceX-app #1542](https://github.com/SemiAnalysisAI/InferenceX-app/pull/1542) | Display the Infera SGLang framework name in the dashboard. | DRAFT / `4aa976240e` | Dashboard review/merge after recipe coordination. |
| [kvcache-ai/Mooncake #4340](https://github.com/kvcache-ai/Mooncake/pull/4340) | HIP IPC suballocation relocation | READY / `9b4b049d9c` | salexspb owns root fix; our R018/R019 evidence is posted. Not used in llr37 RDMA recipe. |
| [kvcache-ai/Mooncake #4953](https://github.com/kvcache-ai/Mooncake/pull/4953) | Asynchronous HIP copy submission | READY / `35c488e938` | Track interaction with #5005; source API unchanged, combined runtime not qualified. |
| [kvcache-ai/Mooncake #5030](https://github.com/kvcache-ai/Mooncake/pull/5030) | Wheel structured-ranges packaging fix | MERGED / `a068e70bef` | Merged and included in #5005 rebase; prior wheel blocker cleared. |

| [sgl-project/sglang #45453](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/45453) | Agree across ranks before deferred KV release | MERGED / `2647c3761e` | Merged release hunk; residual empty-queue polling guard has no current reproducer. |
