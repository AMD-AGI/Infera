# Pending handoff for the next user session

Updated: **2026-11-09T21:10:26.768226+00:00**.

These items remain open until supported by resolution evidence or an explicit exclusion under the [CI scope policy](CI_SCOPE_POLICY.md). Reporting them to the user does not resolve them; scope exclusion is not test success.

## #46820: Base passed; HaiShaw approved, but REVIEW_REQUIRED remains. AMD PP retains transfer/HTTP errors before missing answer: basic 6/6 and PP 2/3 passed, two later files unexecuted. Recorded launches disable changed send. Socket/source review and default-unbounded-HWM limits remain.

Tracking key: `pr46820-base-review`.

Next action: Maintainers complete common-code/socket review and merge assessment. AMD CI owners correlate transfer peers and compare the same revision/environment; preserve passing Base and avoid speculative metrics changes.

## #46830: Current head passed 30 Base and 17 AMD stage jobs. B200 DSA has 9 passes and 8 skips. Consumer/deadlock, CUDA/ROCm review and source qualifications remain.

Tracking key: `pr46830-base-review`.

Next action: Maintainers assess affected-path coverage and skipped B200 cases, then complete review. Preserve maintainer commits, fixture repair and passing runs.

## #45524: Base passed 27 functional jobs. AMD retains 12 stage successes, one failed shard and four skipped stages. Shard 6 exited 255 after starting tests; logs return 404. First exception, source equivalence and historical AWQ/PP review remain unresolved.

Tracking key: `pr45524-external-ci-review`.

Next action: External author eaglewangao-us/maintainers retrieve runner logs and recover coverage; complete source-equivalence review while preserving passing Base/disaggregation and the frozen producer patch.

## #46918: Base has 36 functional successes and two shards cancelled without tests. Bot annotation is known; cancellation policy is not. Main conflict remains. Validation at 9763ef56 does not qualify current head/image.

Tracking key: `pr46918-external-ci-integration`.

Next action: External author yu-depend/maintainers resolve conflicts, recover cancelled coverage, complete review and stock-image integration; preserve frozen workaround and scoped MI355X evidence.

## #47276: Attempt 7 retains 22 functional successes. B0 graph comparison failed after ten passing files, leaving 25/36 unexecuted and C skipped. Helper refused hourly interval. No matching upstream repair established. Optional deployment, overlap and numerical/source review remain.

Tracking key: `pr47276-base-overlap-source`.

Next action: Worker rechecks recovery after priority PRs, no earlier than 2026-11-09T21:40:17.530195+00:00, inspecting older-created eligible Base first. Runner owner captures comparison tuple/dtype, tensors and replay metadata. Preserve optional llr37-disabled role, #45307 coordination and exact numerical/source/run qualifications.

## #47278: Attempt 8 retains 37 functional successes, four JIT suites, one benchmark and one empty job; B2 cancelled before tests. Fresh helper refusal confirms required main 50322ac7 absent. Historical FDFO left 31 files unexecuted. Numerical integration conflicts remain.

Tracking key: `pr47278-cancelled-base-retry-scope`.

Next action: Yihou/kernel maintainer integrates required main with numerical validation, preserving BF16 partials and DCP/LSE; resume helper recovery afterward.

## #47278: Inherited AMD attempt 2 passed 18 stage jobs. BF16/DCP/LSE review, exact run-to-source archiving and combined-stack qualifications remain; existing evidence does not qualify a reconciled kernel.

Tracking key: `pr47278-amd-validation-source`.

Next action: Yihou/maintainers finish review and source/run archiving; validate numerical behavior after conflict reconciliation.

- [Evidence](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/actions/runs/41467616407/attempts/2)
- [Evidence](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/actions/runs/41467616407/job/126709688128)

## #47897: Base passed 27 functional jobs. Inherited AMD MIOpen/PP failures and Xeon checkout/package mismatch remain; ARM64 passed. MIOpen ran zero cases, leaving five later files unexecuted; PP left two files unexecuted. Failing Xeon suite left 16/23 files unexecuted.

Tracking key: `pr47897-architecture-api-ci`.

Next action: CI maintainers repair database access, investigate PP peers and align CPU revisions; preserve passing Base and separate source/numerical qualifications.

## #47897: Run-to-source archival mapping and long-context numerical qualification remain. Short-context GSM8K does not establish equivalence or long-context DSA accuracy.

Tracking key: `pr47897-source-long-context`.

Next action: Archive exact evidence and complete unequal paired-row/table-length, dispatch/fallback and long-context review.

- [Evidence](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/47897)

## #47872: Attempt 16 failed: ten files passed before FlashInfer MLA EAGLE graph mismatch (1/6; maximum absolute difference 43), leaving 25/36 files unexecuted and C skipped. Twenty-two functional successes are retained; no newly successful functional job. Helper refused hourly interval. No matching merged repair established; main conflict and source/long-context qualifications remain.

Tracking key: `pr47872-new-head-ci-validation`.

Next action: Worker rechecks recovery no earlier than 2026-11-09T21:40:17.530195+00:00 after priority PRs and fresh eligibility. Runner owner captures comparison tuple/dtype, tensors and replay metadata. Yihou/kernel maintainer reconciles main and completes source/long-context review, preserving opt-in behavior, min(length,2048), exact fallbacks, valid ties, measured 32k regression and source-specific MI355X limits.

## #47897: Xeon test_server_args.py cannot import _paged_experts_num_resident from the installed package. Matching inherited failure remains; checkout/package alignment is unresolved.

Tracking key: `pr47897-cpu-source-alignment`.

Next action: CI maintainers install and test the same revision, then recover the shard; avoid unrelated parser backports.

- [Evidence](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/actions/runs/41601317546/job/125839112259)

## #47278: Fresh helper refusal confirms required main 50322ac7 absent; live PR remains CONFLICTING. Inherited scaled-KV, block-sizing, GROUP_W, cache/async-copy and split-K conflict analysis requires numerical reconciliation beyond routine CPU-only repair.

Tracking key: `pr47278-main-kernel-conflict`.

Next action: Yihou/kernel maintainer integrates main with numerical validation, preserving BF16 partials and DCP/LSE; retain source/run and combined-stack limits.
